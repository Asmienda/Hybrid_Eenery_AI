#  AI-Powered Hybrid Energy Prediction for Inland Vessels
This project uses machine learning to predict energy demand for inland vessels operating in Nigeria, with a focus on hybrid renewable energy (especially solar). The goal is to support sustainable energy planning for water transport in developing regions.

# Why This Project?

Inland waterway transport is growing in Nigeria, but it relies heavily on fuel based engines.
This project explores AI-based forecasting for solar hybrid energy use on boats.
It is aligned with my motivation for applying to the EMShip+ Erasmus Mundus program, combining computer engineering, sustainability, and marine technology.
